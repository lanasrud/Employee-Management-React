# Employee Management App

The Employee Management App is a simple React web application developed for learning purposes as part of a module requirement. The project focuses on practicing core React concepts such as components, state management, props, routing, and form handling.

This project was created to practice building applications using React, understand component-based development, learn how to manage data using state and props, implement navigation between pages using React Router, and design a simple dashboard-style user interface.

The application allows users to add new employees using a form, display employees in a table, view employee details on a separate page, delete employees, and navigate between pages using React Router. The interface is styled to resemble a simple dashboard layout.

Technologies used in this project include React, Vite, React Router DOM, JavaScript, and CSS.
